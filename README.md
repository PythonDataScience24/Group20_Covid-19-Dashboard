# COVID-19 Dashboard

## Running the program

Run the script `script.py` with python 3, without any args. Make sure that 
the modules listed in `requirements.txt` are installed in the python 
environment.

## What the program currently does

The data is imported and simple statistics are calculated.

## Background info

We will create a reporting tool for the Covid-19 situation that outputs the 
cases and deaths across the world. This readme will be updated and expanded 
once we actually start with the project's implementation.

Our goal is to compute simple statistics of the Covid-19 infections data, 
and then provide visualisations about the trend of infections and deaths
across countries, so that a user can get an overview of the data.
