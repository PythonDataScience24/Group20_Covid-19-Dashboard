# COVID-19 Dashboard

We will create a reporting tool for the Covid-19 situation that outputs the 
cases and deaths across the world. This readme will be updated and expanded 
once we actually start with the project's implementation.

Our goal is to compute simple statistics of the Covid-19 infections data, 
and then provide visualisations about the trend of infections and deaths
across countries, so that a user can get an overview of the data.
