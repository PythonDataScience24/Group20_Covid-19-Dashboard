# COVID-19 Dashboard

## Running the program

Run the script `script.py` with python 3, without any args. Make sure that 
the modules listed in `requirements.txt` are installed in the python 
environment.

The application is a web app, and is viewable in the browser on http://127.0.0.1:8050/

## What the program currently does

The data is imported and simple statistics are calculated.

The dashboard allows the user to input different countries and regions and 
select a timeframe. 

According to the user input two line plots are generated which display the 
number of cases and deaths over the timeframe.

Additionally he can select whether he wants the data to be normalized.

## Background info

We will create a reporting tool for the Covid-19 situation that outputs the 
cases and deaths across the world. This readme will be updated and expanded 
once we actually start with the project's implementation.

Our goal is to compute simple statistics of the Covid-19 infections data, 
and then provide visualisations about the trend of infections and deaths
across countries, so that a user can get an overview of the data.
